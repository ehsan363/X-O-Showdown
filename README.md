# X-O-Showdown
A Tic Tac Toe game where there will be NO Tie

## The Game
The ultimate goal of this game is to have a game of Tic Tac Toe and not end up in a tie. This is acheived by erasing the first move made by the player in the total three that follows until victory is achived. 
The Game is there all finished. Use it for whatever you like :)   
  
In this game every move made by both players after move three will erase their first move from the previous three moves. Therefore there will be only three positions taken by one side at all time (maximum). The game will continue until one side wins.
